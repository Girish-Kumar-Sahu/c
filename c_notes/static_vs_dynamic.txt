🧠 Core idea (in one line)

Static = decided before the program runs
Dynamic = decided while the program is running

That’s it. Everything comes from this.

1️⃣ Static vs Dynamic Typing
🔹 Static typing (C, C++)
int x = 5;
x = 3.5;   // ❌ not allowed


Meaning:

Type of x is fixed at compile time

Compiler already knows:

how much memory

how to treat the value

You cannot change it later.

🔹 Dynamic typing (Python, JS)
x = 5
x = "hello"   # ✅ allowed


Meaning:

Type is decided at runtime

Variable is just a label

Value carries the type, not the variable

🧠 Mental model

C: “This box will always store an integer”

Python/JS: “This name points to whatever value I give it”

2️⃣ Static vs Dynamic Memory Allocation

This is HUGE in C.

🔹 Static (or automatic) memory
int arr[10];


Size fixed

Memory allocated on stack

Exists only inside the scope

Fast, but limited

Decided before or at function entry.

🔹 Dynamic memory
int *arr = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));


Size decided at runtime

Memory allocated on heap

You control lifetime

Must free manually

🧠 Analogy

Static → hostel room (fixed size)

Dynamic → hotel room (book as needed)

3️⃣ Static vs Dynamic Binding
🔹 Static binding (C)
add(2, 3);


Function call decided at compile time

Faster

No surprises

🔹 Dynamic binding (JS, Python)
obj.method()


Method decided at runtime

Flexible (polymorphism)

Slightly slower

4️⃣ Static vs Dynamic Libraries
🔹 Static library

Code copied into your program

Bigger executable

No external dependency

🔹 Dynamic library

Loaded at runtime (.dll, .so)

Smaller executable

Needs library present

(You’ll see this later in OS / systems)

🔑 Why C feels “strict”

Because everything is mostly static:

static typing

static binding

explicit memory control

This makes C:

very fast

predictable

close to hardware

🔥 Why Python/JS feels “easy”

Because everything is dynamic:

dynamic typing

dynamic memory

runtime decisions

This makes them:

flexible

beginner-friendly

slower

Term	Meaning
Static	Decided before execution
Dynamic	Decided during execution
